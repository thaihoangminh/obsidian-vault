#Course #Prompt 

## Overview
In **ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers,** you will learn how to use a large language model (LLM) to quickly build new and powerful applications.  Using the OpenAI API, you’ll be able to quickly build capabilities that learn to innovate and create value in ways that were cost-prohibitive, highly technical, or simply impossible before now. This short course taught by Isa Fulford (OpenAI) and Andrew Ng (DeepLearning.AI) will describe how LLMs work, provide best practices for prompt engineering, and show how LLM APIs can be used in applications for a variety of tasks, including:
- [[#Summarizing]] (e.g., summarizing user reviews for brevity)
- [[#Inferring]] (e.g., sentiment classification, topic extraction)
- [[#Transforming]] text (e.g., translation, spelling & grammar correction)
- [[#Expanding]] (e.g., automatically writing emails)

In addition, you’ll learn two key principles for writing effective prompts, how to systematically engineer good prompts, and also learn to build a custom chatbot. All concepts are illustrated with numerous examples, which you can play with directly in our Jupyter notebook environment to get hands-on experience with prompt engineering


---

## Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions

### Tactic 1: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
- Delimiters can be anything like: ``` (triple backticks), """ (triple quotes), — (triple dashes), < > (angle brackets), <tag> </tag> (XML tags), :

```
Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks into a single sentence.

```You should express what you want a model to do by providing instructions that are as clear and specific as you can possibly make them. This will guide the model towards the desired output, and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a clear prompt with writing a short prompt. In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity and context for the model, which can lead to more detailed and relevant outputs.```
```

### Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output

```
Generate a list of three made-up book titles along with their authors and genres. Provide them in JSON format with the following keys:  book_id, title, author, and genre.
```

### Tactic 3: Check whether conditions are satisfied
Check assumptions required to do the task

```
You will be provided with text delimited by triple quotes. If it contains a sequence of instructions, re-write those instructions in the following format:  
Step 1 - ... 
Step 2 - … 
… 
Step N - …

If the text does not contain a sequence of instructions, then simply write "No steps provided.”

"""Making a cup of tea is easy! First, you need to get some water boiling. While that's happening, grab a cup and put a tea bag in it. Once the water is hot enough, just pour it over the tea bag. Let it sit for a bit so the tea can steep. After a few minutes, take out the tea bag. If you like, you can add some sugar or milk to taste. And that's it! You've got yourself a delicious cup of tea to enjoy."""
```

```
You will be provided with text delimited by triple quotes. If it contains a sequence of instructions, re-write those instructions in the following format:  
Step 1 - ... 
Step 2 - … 
… 
Step N - …

If the text does not contain a sequence of instructions, then simply write "No steps provided.”
 """The sun is shining brightly today, and the birds aresinging. It's a beautiful day to go for a walk in the park. The flowers are blooming, and the trees are swaying gently in the breeze. People are out and about, enjoying the lovely weather. Some are having picnics, while others are playing games or simply relaxing on the grass. It's a perfect day to spend time outdoors and appreciate the beauty of nature."""
```

### Tactic 4: Few-short prompting
Give successful examples of completing tasks. Then ask the model to perform the task

```
Your task is to answer in a consistent style.

<child>: Teach me about patience.

<grandparent>: The river that carves the deepest valley flows from a modest spring; the grandest symphony originates from a single note; the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.

<child>: Teach me about resilience.
```


---

## Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”
### Tactic 1: Specify the steps required to complete a task

```
Perform the following actions:
1 - Summarize the following text delimited by triple backticks with 1 sentence.
2 - Translate the summary into French.
3 - List each name in the French summary.
4 - Output a JSON object that contains the following keys: french_summary, num_names.

Separate your answers with line breaks.

Text:
```In a charming village, siblings Jack and Jill set out on a quest to fetch water from a hilltop well. As they climbed, singing joyfully, misfortune struck—Jack tripped on a stone and tumbled down the hill, with Jill following suit. Though slightly battered, the pair returned home to comforting embraces. Despite the mishap, their adventurous spirits remained undimmed, and they continued exploring with delight.```
```

Ask for output in a specified format:

```
Your task is to perform the following actions:  
1 - Summarize the following text delimited by <> with 1 sentence.
2 - Translate the summary into French. 
3 - List each name in the French summary. 
4 - Output a JSON object that contains the following keys: french_summary, num_names. 

Use the following format: 
Text: <text to summarize>
Summary: <summary>
Translation: <summary translation>
Names: <list of names in summary>
Output JSON: <json with summary and num_names>

Text: <In a charming village, siblings Jack and Jill set out on a quest to fetch water from a hilltop well. As they climbed, singing joyfully, misfortune struck—Jack tripped on a stone and tumbled down the hill, with Jill following suit. Though slightly battered, the pair returned home to comforting embraces. Despite the mishap, their adventurous spirits remained undimmed, and they continued exploring with delight.>
```

### Tactic 2: Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion

```
Determine if the student's solution is correct or not.  
Question: I'm building a solar power installation and I need help working out the financials.  
- Land costs $100 / square foot 
- I can buy solar panels for $250 / square foot
- I negotiated a contract for maintenance that will cost me a flat $100k per year, and an additional $10 / square foot
What is the total cost for the first year of operations as a function of the number of square feet? 

Student's Solution: Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.
Costs:
1. Land cost: 100x
2. Solar panel cost: 250x
3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x
Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 100x = 450x + 100,000
```

Note that the student's solution is actually not correct. We can fix this by instructing the model to work out its own solution first.

```
Your task is to determine if the student's solution is correct or not.
To solve the problem do the following:
- First, work out your own solution to the problem including the final total. 
- Then compare your solution to the student's solution and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not. 
Don't decide if the student's solution is correct until you have done the problem yourself.

Use the following format:
Question: <question here>
Student's solution: <student's solution here>
Actual solution: <steps to work out the solution and your solution here>
Is the student's solution the same as actual solution just calculated: <yes or no>
Student grade: <correct or incorrect>

Question:
"""I'm building a solar power installation and I need help working out the financials.
- Land costs $100 / square foot
- I can buy solar panels for $250 / square foot
- I negotiated a contract for maintenance that will cost me a flat $100k per year, and an additional $10 / square foot
What is the total cost for the first year of operations as a function of the number of square feet."""

Student's solution:
"""Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.
Costs:
1. Land cost: 100x
2. Solar panel cost: 250x
3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x
Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 100x = 450x + 100,000"""

Actual solution:
```

# Summarizing
In this lesson, you will summarize text with a focus on specific topics.

```
Text to summary: Got this panda plush toy for my daughter's birthday, who loves it and takes it everywhere. It's soft and super cute, and its face has a friendly look. It's a bit small for what I paid though. I think there might be other options that are bigger for the same price. It arrived a day earlier than expected, so I got to play with it myself before I gave it to her.
```

Summarize with a word/sentence/character limit:

```
Your task is to generate a short summary of a product review from an ecommerce site. 

Summarize the review below, delimited by triple backticks, in at most 30 words. 

Review: ```{prod_review}```
```

Summarize with a focus on shipping and delivery:

```
Your task is to generate a short summary of a product review from an ecommerce site to give feedback to the Shipping deparmtment. 

Summarize the review below, delimited by triple backticks, in at most 30 words, and focusing on any aspects that mention shipping and delivery of the product. 

Review: ```{prod_review}```
```

Summarize with a focus on price and value:

```
Your task is to generate a short summary of a product review from an ecommerce site to give feedback to the pricing deparmtment, responsible for determining the price of the product.  

Summarize the review below, delimited by triple backticks, in at most 30 words, and focusing on any aspects that are relevant to the price and perceived value. 

Review: ```{prod_review}```
```

**Comment**
- Summaries include topics that are not related to the topic of focus.


Try "extract" instead of "summarize”:

```
Your task is to extract relevant information from a product review from an ecommerce site to give feedback to the Shipping department. 

From the review below, delimited by triple quotes extract the information relevant to shipping and delivery. Limit to 30 words. 

Review: ```{prod_review}```
```

Summarize multiple product reviews:
Review 1:

```
Got this panda plush toy for my daughter's birthday, who loves it and takes it everywhere. It's soft and super cute, and its face has a friendly look. It's a bit small for what I paid though. I think there might be other options that are bigger for the same price. It arrived a day earlier than expected, so I got to play with it myself before I gave it to her.
```

Review 2:

```
Needed a nice lamp for my bedroom, and this one had additional storage and not too high of a price point. Got it fast - arrived in 2 days. The string to the lamp broke during the transit and the company happily sent over a new one. Came within a few days as well. It was easy to put together. Then I had a missing part, so I contacted their support and they very quickly got me the missing piece! Seems to me to be a great company that cares about their customers and products.
```

Review 3:

```
My dental hygienist recommended an electric toothbrush, which is why I got this. The battery life seems to be pretty impressive so far. After initial charging and leaving the charger plugged in for the first week to condition the battery, I've unplugged the charger and been using it for twice daily brushing for the last 3 weeks all on the same charge. But the toothbrush head is too small. I’ve seen baby toothbrushes bigger than this one. I wish the head was bigger with different length bristles to get between teeth better because this one doesn’t.  Overall if you can get this one around the $50 mark, it's a good deal. The manufactuer's replacements heads are pretty expensive, but you can get generic ones that're more reasonably priced. This toothbrush makes me feel like I've been to the dentist every day. My teeth feel sparkly clean!
```

Review 4:

```
So, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal sale for around $49 in the month of November, about half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) around the second week of December the prices all went up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part where the blade locks into place doesn’t look as good as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the blender first then pulverize them in the serving size I want in the blender then switch to the whipping blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. I called customer service but the warranty expired already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall quality has gone done in these types of products, so they are kind of counting on brand recognition and consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about two days.
```

Prompt:

# Transforming
In this notebook, we will explore how to use Large Language Models for text transformation tasks such as language translation, spelling and grammar checking, tone adjustment, and format conversion.

**Translation**
ChatGPT is trained with sources in many languages. This gives the model the ability to do translation. Here are some examples of how to use this capability.


```
Translate the following English text to Spanish: ```Hi, I would like to order a blender```
```


```
Tell me which language this is: ```Combien coûte le lampadaire?```
```


```
Translate the following text to French and Spanish and English pirate: ```I want to order a basketball```
```


```
Translate the following text to Spanish in both the formal and informal forms: 'Would you like to order a pillow?'
```

**Universal Translator**
Imagine you are in charge of IT at a large multinational e-commerce company. Users are messaging you with IT issues in all their native languages. Your staff is from all over the world and speaks only their native languages. You need a universal translator!


```
user_messages = [
  "La performance du système est plus lente que d'habitude.",  # System performance is slower than normal         
  "Mi monitor tiene píxeles que no se iluminan.",              # My monitor has pixels that are not lighting
  "Il mio mouse non funziona",                                 # My mouse is not working
  "Mój klawisz Ctrl jest zepsuty",                             # My keyboard has a broken control key
  "我的屏幕在闪烁"                                               # My screen is flashing
] 
```


```
for issue in user_messages:
    prompt = f"Tell me what language this is: ```{issue}```"
    lang = get_completion(prompt)
    print(f"Original message ({lang}): {issue}")

    prompt = f"""
    Translate the following  text to English and Korean: ```{issue}```
    """
    response = get_completion(prompt)
    print(response, "\n")
```


**Tone Transformation**
Writing can vary based on the intended audience. ChatGPT can produce different tones.


```
Translate the following from slang to a business letter: 'Dude, This is Joe, check out this spec on this standing lamp.'
```

**Format Conversion**
ChatGPT can translate between formats. The prompt should describe the input and output formats.



```
data_json = { "resturant employees" :[ 
    {"name":"Shyam", "email":"shyamjaiswal@gmail.com"},
    {"name":"Bob", "email":"bob32@gmail.com"},
    {"name":"Jai", "email":"jai87@gmail.com"}
]}

prompt = f"""
Translate the following python dictionary from JSON to an HTML table with column headers and title: {data_json}
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

**Spellcheck/Grammar check.**
Here are some examples of common grammar and spelling problems and the LLM's response.

To signal to the LLM that you want it to proofread your text, you instruct the model to 'proofread' or 'proofread and correct'.


```
text = [ 
  "The girl with the black and white puppies have a ball.",  # The girl has a ball.
  "Yolanda has her notebook.", # ok
  "Its going to be a long day. Does the car need it’s oil changed?",  # Homonyms
  "Their goes my freedom. There going to bring they’re suitcases.",  # Homonyms
  "Your going to need you’re notebook.",  # Homonyms
  "That medicine effects my ability to sleep. Have you heard of the butterfly affect?", # Homonyms
  "This phrase is to cherck chatGPT for speling abilitty"  # spelling
]
for t in text:
    prompt = f"""Proofread and correct the following text and rewrite the corrected version. If you don't find and errors, just say "No errors found". Don't use any punctuation around the text: ```{t}```"""
    response = get_completion(prompt)
    print(response)
```



```
text = f"""
Got this for my daughter for her birthday cuz she keeps taking mine from my room.  Yes, adults also like pandas too.  She takes it everywhere with her, and it's super soft and cute. One of the ears is a bit lower than the other, and I don't think that was designed to be asymmetrical. It's a bit small for what I paid for it though. I think there might be other options that are bigger for the same price. It arrived a day earlier than expected, so I got to play with it myself before I gave it to my daughter.
"""
prompt = f"proofread and correct this review: ```{text}```"
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```


```
prompt = f"""proofread and correct this review. Make it more compelling. Ensure it follows APA style guide and targets an advanced reader. 
Output in markdown format.
Text: ```{text}```
```

# Expanding
In this lesson, you will generate customer service emails that are tailored to each customer's review.


```
def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo",temperature=0): # Andrew mentioned that the prompt/ completion paradigm is preferable for this class
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=temperature, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]

context = [ {'role':'system', 'content': """
You are OrderBot, an automated service to collect orders for a pizza restaurant. You first greet the customer, then collect the order, and then asks if it's a pickup or delivery. You wait to collect the entire order, then summarize it and check for a final time if the customer wants to add anything else. If it's a delivery, you ask for an address. Finally, you collect the payment. Make sure to clarify all options, extras and sizes to uniquely identify the item from the menu. You respond in a short, very conversational friendly style. 
The menu includes:
pepperoni pizza  12.95, 10.00, 7.00,
cheese pizza   10.95, 9.25, 6.50,
eggplant pizza   11.95, 9.75, 6.75,
